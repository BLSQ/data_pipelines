Data Pipelines
===============================

A lot of the data manipulation we are doing can be split in pipelines with specific roles.

Data Mapping
-------------------------

This includes mapping data sources between them (indicators, orgUnits…), mapping indicators with concepts etc… Our vision is most of this work should happen outside of our team (HFR, D2D…) but we still need to do some of this work on the conceptual level and to find relevant information in highly dimensional databases, and need some clear processes to do so.

Data Audit
--------------------------
A lot of the data


Data Transform
-------------------------

Once data has been identified and mapped, we need to transform it before it is modeled. Due to type of real life data we use, this is where most of our added value is for now. This includes data sources reconciliation, data imputation, data characterization.


Data Modeling
--------------------------
The data modeling is all the analytical work we want to do with the data to produce some value. This includes building composite indicators, any kind of statistical modeling or learning we are doing.



Data Presentation
--------------------------
Finally, we have to format outputs to fit both the needs of our clients, and the tools we use to communicate or present our work.
